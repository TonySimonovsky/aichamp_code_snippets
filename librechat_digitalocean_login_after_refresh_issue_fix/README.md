# TASK
Install SSL certificate on DigitalOcean to remove the problem of logging out from LibreChat on every refresh

# CHALLENGE
While online tutorials how to do something (for example install SSL) are a great resource, one faces challenges almost 100% of the time, as tutorials are rarely universally applicable.

# GENERAL SOLUTION
Use AI assistant together with the tutorial to get things done.

# SOLUTION for the TASK
1. Use this instruction as a base guide: https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/how-do-i-install-an-ssl-certificate-on-a-droplet/

2. Use Claude (or other AI assistant) to help you on the way. Here's my chat with Claude that helped me get it done: [librechat_digitalocean_login_after_refresh_issue_fix_claude_convo.md](https://github.com/TonySimonovsky/aichamp_code_snippets/blob/main/claude_chat_export/librechat_digitalocean_login_after_refresh_issue_fix_claude_convo.md)
